Learn Fetch and Promises by Building an fCC Authors Page by freeCodeCamp

One common aspect of web development is learning how to fetch data from an external API, then work with asynchronous JavaScript.

This freeCodeCamp authors page project showed me how to use the fetch method, then dynamically update the DOM to display the fetched data.

This project also teached me how to paginate my data so I can load results in batches.
