Build a Palindrome Checker Project - Certification Project by freeCodeCamp.

This is one of the required projects to earn my certification.

For this project, I built an application that checks whether a given text is a palindrome.

PS: A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
