This decimalToBinary function is complete. But there are some ways to improve it. For example, it's not necessary to keep track of the inputs and quotients. We can clean things up so the function is more efficient.

  // For the decimal to binary conversion, you need to divide input by 2 until the quotient, or the result of dividing two numbers, is 0. But since you don't know how many times you need to divide input by 2, you can use a while loop to run a block of code as long as input is greater than 0 and can be divided.
  // As a reminder, a while loop is used to run a block of code as long as the condition evaluates to true, and the condition is checked before the code block is executed.
  // The tricky part about while loops is that, if you're not careful, they can run forever. This is called an infinite loop, and can cause your browser to crash.
  // To avoid infinite loops, you need to make sure that the condition for the while loop eventually becomes false. In this case, you want to make sure that the input variable eventually becomes 0.

  // while loop to run a block of code as long as input is greater than 0 and can be divided.

The best way to handle this is to round down to the nearest whole number. // Math.floor() function to round down the quotient of input divided by 2 before it's assigned to quotient.

    const remainder = input % 2; // to calculate the remainder of input divided by 2. You can do this by using the remainder operator (%), which returns the remainder of the division of two numbers

// learning a bit about the call stack and recursion

/* In computer science, a stack is a data structure where items are stored in a LIFO (last-in-first-out) manner. If you imagine a stack of books, the last book you add to the stack is the first book you can take off the stack. Or an array where you can only .push() and .pop() elements.

The call stack is a collection of function calls stored in a stack structure. When you call a function, it is added to the top of the stack, and when it returns, it is removed from the top / end of the stack.

You'll see this in action by creating mock call stack. */ /*

  `b(): returns 'is ' + c()`, // since a() calls b(), the function b() is added to the call stack.
  `c(): returns 'awesome!'`, // since b() calls c(), the function c() is added to the call stack.
  // Your call stack is complete. As you can see, a() is at the bottom or beginning of the stack, which calls b() in the middle, which calls c() at the top or end. Once they're all in place, they begin to execute from top to bottom.
  // c() executes, returns the string "awesome!", and is popped off or removed from the top of the stack.
  // Then the function b() executes and evaluates to "is " + "awesome!".
  // Now that b() has executed, pop it off the call stack. Then, update your mock call to a() to the following: "a(): returns 'freeCodeCamp ' + 'is awesome!'".
  // Finally, a() returns the concatenated string "freeCodeCamp is awesome!".

  If you test your code, you'll notice that your console logs are not in the expected order. Instead of logging "free", pausing for a second before logging "Code", and finally logging "Camp", you'll see this:
  Example Code
  free
  Camp
  Code
  This is because the setTimeout() function is asynchronous, meaning that it doesn't stop the execution of the rest of your code. All the code in the showAnimation() function runs line by line, but because setTimeout() is asynchronous, free and Camp are logged to the console immediately, and then Code is logged to the console after a one second delay.
  One way to fix this is to use multiple setTimeout() functions. Use setTimeout() to log free to the console after half a second, or 500 milliseconds.
*/
  /*
While asynchronous, or async, code can be difficult to understand at first, it has many advantages. One of the most important is that it allows you to write non-blocking code.
For example, imagine you're baking a cake, and you put the cake in the oven and set a timer. You don't have to sit in front of the oven waiting the entire time â€“ you can wash dishes, read a book, or do anything else while you wait for the timer to go off.
Async code works in a similar way. You can start an async operation and other parts of your code will still work while that operation is running.
You'll learn more about async code in future projects, but the setTimeout() function is a good introduction.
