Build a Telephone Number Validator Project by freeCodeCamp

This is one of the required projects to claim my certification.

For this project, I built an application that checks if a number is a valid United States phone number.

In the US, phone numbers can be formatted in many ways. Here are some examples of valid formats for US phone numbers:

1 555-555-5555
1 (555) 555-5555
1(555)555-5555
1 555 555 5555
5555555555
555-555-5555
(555)555-5555

Note that the area code is required. Also, if the country code is provided, you must confirm that the country code is 1.
