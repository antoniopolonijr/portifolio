Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game by freeCodeCamp.

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that you can use to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript.

In this practice project, I learned fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Role Playing Game. I learned how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.
