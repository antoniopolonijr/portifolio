Learn Form Validation by Building a Calorie Counter by freeCodeCamp.

Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, I learned how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.

In this practice project, I learned basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.
