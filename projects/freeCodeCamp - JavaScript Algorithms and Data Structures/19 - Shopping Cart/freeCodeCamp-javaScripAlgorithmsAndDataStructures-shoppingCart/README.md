Learn Basic OOP by Building a Shopping Cart by freeCodeCamp

OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, developers use objects and classes to structure their code.

In this shopping cart project, I learned how to define classes and use them. I created class instances and implement methods for data manipulation.

This project covered concepts like the ternary operator, the spread operator, the this keyword, and more.
