// In mathematics, an infix is a mathematical operator that appears between its two operands. For example, 1 + 2 is an infix expression. To parse these expressions, you will need to map the symbols to relevant functions. Declare an infixToFunction variable, and assign it an empty object.

The concept of returning a function within a function is called currying. This approach allows you to create a variable that holds a function to be called later, but with a reference to the parameters of the outer function call.
For example:
Example Code
const innerOne = elemValue(1);
const final = innerOne("A");
innerOne would be your inner function, with num set to 1, and final would have the value of the cell with the id of A1. This is possible because functions have access to all variables declared at their creation. This is called closure.
*/
  /*
In your elemValue function, you explicitly declared a function called inner and returned it. However, because you are using arrow syntax, you can implicitly return a function. For example:
Example Code
const curry = soup => veggies => {};
curry is a function which takes a soup parameter and returns a function which takes a veggies parameter. Using this syntax, update your addCharacters function to return an empty function which takes a character2 parameter.

  // Your inner functions can also return a function. Using the same arrow syntax, update your addCharacters function to return a third function which takes a num parameter.

  // Your addCharacters function ultimately returns a range of characters. You want it to return an array of cell ids. Chain the .map() method to your charRange() call. Do not pass a callback function yet.
  /*
You can pass a function reference as a callback parameter. A function reference is a function name without the parentheses. For example:
Example Code
const myFunc = (val) => `value: ${val}`;
const array = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = array.map(myFunc);
The .map() method here will call the myFunc function, passing the same arguments that a .map() callback takes. The first argument is the value of the array at the current iteration, so newArray would be [value: 1, value: 2, value: 3].

  // Because elemValue returns a function, your addCharacters function ultimately returns an array of function references.

  // Declare a rangeExpanded variable and assign it the result of calling the .replace() method of your x parameter. Pass the rangeRegex variable as the argument.
  // The second argument to the .replace() method does not have to be a string. You can instead pass a callback function to run more complex logic on the matched string. The callback function takes a few parameters. The first is the matched string. Pass an empty callback function to your .replace() call, and give it a match parameter.
  // The callback function then has a parameter for each capture group in the regular expression. In your case, rangeRegex has four capture groups: the first letter, the first numbers, the second letter, and the second numbers. Give your callback function four more parameters to match those capture groups: char1, num1, char2, and num2. char will be short for character.
  // Have your callback implicitly return the result of calling rangeFromString() with num1 and num2 as the arguments.

  Your addCharacters(char1) is also returning a function, which returns another function. You need to make another function call to access that innermost function reference for the .map() callback. JavaScript allows you to immediately invoke returned functions:
  Example Code
  myFunc(1)("hi");
  Immediately invoke the function returned from your addCharacters(char1) call, and pass char2 as the argument.

  // Now that your .map() function is receiving the innermost function reference from addCharacters, it will properly iterate over the elements and pass each element as n to that function. You'll notice that you are not using your match parameter. In JavaScript, it is common convention to prefix an unused parameter with an underscore _. You could also leave the parameter empty like so: (, char1) but it is often clearer to name the parameter for future readability. Prefix your match parameter with an underscore.
