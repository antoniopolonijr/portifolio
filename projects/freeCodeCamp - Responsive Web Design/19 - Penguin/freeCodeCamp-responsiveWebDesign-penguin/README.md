Learn CSS Transforms by Building a Penguin by freeCodeCamp.

You can transform HTML elements to create appealing designs that draw your reader's eye. You can use transforms to rotate elements, scale them, and more.

In this course, I built a penguin. I used CSS transforms to position and resize the parts of your penguin, create a background, and animate your work.
