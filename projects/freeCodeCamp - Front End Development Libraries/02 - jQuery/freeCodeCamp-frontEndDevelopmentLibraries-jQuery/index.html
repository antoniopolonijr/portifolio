    <!-- Before we can start using jQuery, we need to add some things to our HTML. First, add a script element at the top of your page. Be sure to close it on the following line. Your browser will run any JavaScript inside a script element, including jQuery. Inside your script element, add this code: $(document).ready(function() { to your script. Then close it on the following line (still inside your script element) with: }); We'll learn more about functions later. The important thing to know is that code you put inside this function will run as soon as your browser has loaded your page. This is important because without your document ready function, your code may run before your HTML is rendered, which would cause bugs. -->
    <script>
      $(document).ready(function () {
        /* Now we have a document ready function. Now let's write our first jQuery statement. All jQuery functions start with a $, usually referred to as a dollar sign operator, or as bling. jQuery often selects an HTML element with a selector, then does something to that element. For example, let's make all of your button elements bounce.
              Just add this code inside your document ready function:
              $("button").addClass("animated bounce");
              Note that we've already included both the jQuery library and the Animate.css library in the head. So you are using jQuery to apply the Animate.css bounce class to your button elements. */
        /* $("button").addClass("animated bounce"); */
        /* You see how we made all of your button elements bounce? We selected them with $("button"), then we added some CSS classes to them with .addClass("animated bounce");. You just used jQuery's .addClass() function, which allows you to add classes to elements. First, let's target your div elements with the class well by using the $(".well") selector. Note that, just like with CSS declarations, you type a . before the class's name. Then use jQuery's .addClass() function to add the classes animated and shake. */
        /* $(".well").addClass("animated shake"); */
        /* You can also target elements by their id attributes. First target your button element with the id target3 by using the $("#target3") selector. Note that, just like with CSS declarations, you type a # before the id's name. */
        /* $("#target3").addClass("animated fadeOut"); */

        /* These animations were cool at first, but now they're getting kind of distracting. Delete all three of these jQuery functions from your document ready function, but leave your document ready function itself intact. */

        /* Although it is possible to add multiple classes in a single .addClass() call, let's add them to the same element in three separate ways. Note: You should only be targeting one element and adding only one class at a time. Altogether, your three individual selectors will end up adding the three classes shake, animated, and btn-primary to #target1. */
        /* $("button").addClass("animated");
        $(".btn").addClass("shake");
        $("#target1").addClass("btn-primary"); */

        /* In the same way you can add classes to an element with jQuery's addClass() function, you can remove them with jQuery's removeClass() function. */
        /* $("button").removeClass("btn-default"); /*

        /* Delete your jQuery selectors, leaving an empty document ready function. */

        /* We can also change the CSS of an HTML element directly with jQuery. jQuery has a function called .css() that allows you to change the CSS of an element. This is slightly different from a normal CSS declaration, because the CSS property and its value are in quotes, and separated with a comma instead of a colon. */
        $("#target1").css("color", "red");

        /* You can also change the non-CSS properties of HTML elements with jQuery. For example, you can disable buttons. When you disable a button, it will become grayed-out and can no longer be clicked. jQuery has a function called .prop() that allows you to adjust the properties of elements. */
        $("#target1").prop("disabled", true);

        /* Using jQuery, you can change the text between the start and end tags of an element. You can even change HTML markup. jQuery has a function called .html() that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element. Any content previously within the element will be completely replaced with the content you provide using this function.
        jQuery also has a similar function called .text() that only alters text without adding tags. In other words, this function will not evaluate any HTML tags passed to it, but will instead treat it as the text you want to replace the existing content with.
        Note that while the <i> tag has traditionally been used to emphasize text, it has since been adopted for use as a tag for icons. The <em> tag is now widely accepted as the tag for emphasis. Either will work for this challenge. */
        $("#target4").html("<em>#target4</em>");

        /* jQuery has a function called .remove() that will remove an HTML element entirely. */
        $("#target4").remove();

        /* jQuery has a function called appendTo() that allows you to select HTML elements and append them to another element. */
        $("#target2").appendTo("#right-well");

        /* jQuery has a function called clone() that makes a copy of an element.
        Did you notice this involves sticking two jQuery functions together? This is called function chaining and it's a convenient way to get things done with jQuery. */
        $("#target5").clone().appendTo("#left-well");

        /* Every HTML element has a parent element from which it inherits properties. For example, the h3 element in your jQuery Playground has the parent element of <div class="container-fluid">, which itself has the parent element of body. jQuery has a function called parent() that allows you to access the parent of whichever element you've selected. */
        $("#target1").parent().css("background-color", "red");

        /* When HTML elements are placed one level below another they are called children of that element. For example, the button elements in this challenge with the text #target1, #target2, and #target3 are all children of the <div class="well" id="left-well"> element. jQuery has a function called children() that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected. */
        $("#right-well").children().css("color", "orange");

        /* You've seen why id attributes are so convenient for targeting with jQuery selectors. But you won't always have such neat ids to work with. Fortunately, jQuery has some other tricks for targeting the right elements. jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. The target:nth-child(n) CSS selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type. */
        $(".target:nth-child(2)").addClass("animated bounce");

        /* You can also target elements based on their positions using :odd or :even selectors. Note that jQuery is zero-indexed which means the first element in a selection has a position of 0. This can be a little confusing as, counter-intuitively, :odd selects the second element (position 1), fourth element (position 3), and so on. Remember that even refers to the position of elements with a zero-based system in mind. */
        $(".target:even").addClass("animated shake");

        /* jQuery can target the body element as well. 
        $("body").addClass("animated hinge"); */
