React and Redux

React and Redux are often mentioned together, and with good reason. The developer who created Redux was a React developer who wanted to make it easier to share data across different components.

It's time to combine that knowledge with React. In the React and Redux courses, I built a React component and learn how to manage state locally at the component level, and throughout the entire application with Redux.
