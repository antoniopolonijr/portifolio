    <title>Cat Photo App</title>
    <!-- In the HTML5 and CSS section of freeCodeCamp we built a Cat Photo App. Now let's go back to it. This time, we'll style it using the popular Bootstrap responsive CSS framework. Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design. With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width. You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML: -->
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />

    <!-- Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. These icons can be webfonts or vector graphics. These icons are treated just like fonts. You can specify their size using pixels, and they will assume the font size of their parent HTML elements.
You can include Font Awesome in any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML: -->
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css"
      integrity="sha384-50oBUHEmvpQ+1lW4y57PTFmhCaXp0ML5d60M1M7uH2+nqUivzIebhndOJK28anvf"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />

    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster"
      rel="stylesheet"
      type="text/css"
    />

    <!-- We can clean up our code and make our Cat Photo App look more conventional by using Bootstrap's built-in styles instead of the custom styles we created earlier. Delete the .red-text, p, and .smaller-image CSS declarations from your style element so that the only declarations left in your style element are h2 and thick-green-border. -->
    <style>
      h2 {
        font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
      }
      .thick-green-border {
        border-color: green;
        border-width: 10px;
        border-style: solid;
        border-radius: 50%;
      }
    </style>

    <!-- We should nest all of our HTML (except the link tag and the style element) in a div element with the class container-fluid. -->
    <div class="container-fluid">

      <div class="row">

          <!-- using Bootstrap, we can center our heading element to make it look better. All we need to do is add the class text-center to our h2 element -->

          <h2 class="text-primary text-center">CatPhotoApp</h2>

      <!-- It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen. Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your image. Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page. -->

      <!-- Bootstrap uses a responsive 12-column grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element. Bootstrap has different column width attributes that it uses depending on how wide the user's screen is. For example, phones have narrow screens, and laptops have wider screens. Take for example Bootstrap's col-md-* class. Here, md means medium, and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. In this case, the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop, is being specified. In the Cat Photo App that we're building, we'll use col-xs-*, where xs means extra small (like an extra-small mobile phone screen), and * is the number of columns specifying how many columns wide the element should be. Put the Like, Info and Delete buttons side-by-side by nesting all three of them within one <div class="row"> element, then each of them within a <div class="col-xs-4"> element. The row class is applied to a div, and the buttons themselves can be nested within it. -->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-4">
          <!-- Bootstrap has its own styles for button elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones. Give it the btn and btn-default classes -->
          <!-- Normally, your button elements with the btn and btn-default classes are only as wide as the text that they contain. By making them block elements with the additional class of btn-block, your button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space and any elements following it will flow onto a "new line" below the block. -->
          <!-- The btn-primary class is the main color you'll use in your app. It is useful for highlighting actions you want your user to take. Replace Bootstrap's btn-default class with btn-primary in your button. -->
          <!-- The i element was originally used to make other elements italic, but is now commonly used for icons. You can add the Font Awesome classes to the i element to turn it into an icon, for example:
      <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
      Note that the span element is also acceptable for use with icons.      
      Use Font Awesome to add a thumbs-up icon to your like button by giving it an i element with the classes fas and fa-thumbs-up. Make sure to keep the text Like next to the icon. -->
